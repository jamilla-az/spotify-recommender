    "## Playlist x Unique Songs Sparse Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "For further model building, it will be helpful to have a sparse matrix that encodes our playlists in rows and our unique songs in columns. A one (1) in a particular cell of the matrix means that playlist has that song. A zero (0) means it doesn't. We need to carefully look at sparsity here - a matrix that is too sparse means that using matrix factorization to learn latent variables wouldn't work very well because there aren't enough playlist/song interactions. How much of an impact this has is something that I would like to test by creating matrices of varying sparsity through filtering out playlists with few songs or songs rarely featured. \n",
